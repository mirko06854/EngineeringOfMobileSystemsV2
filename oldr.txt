old :

const throwsandchoose = (): number[] => {
  diceKept(diceList)
    printValues(throwRemainingDiceOnTableFunction(diceKept(diceList).length));
  return diceKept(diceList)
}
console.log(throwsandchoose());




IDEA: try using a switch, for each throw :


if throw = 0 , not keep anything. --> output original list without asking anything.
if throw = 1 , keep how many dices the user says.  --> output these.
if throw = 2, keep the previous printed dice - further choice of users --> output these.
