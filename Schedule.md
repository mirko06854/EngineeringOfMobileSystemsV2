# Schedule for fall semester, 2022

Here is the planned schedule of the class. When a class with a recorded lecture is planned, **you should have watched the recorded lecture before the class**. This way, we can start with clarification questions and, if needed, a quick recap, but then we will focus as much as possible on the exercises and labs.
